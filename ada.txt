“I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; 
because, understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction 
of all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur to me, 
how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at…”

- Ada Lovelace
